66,"it's an interesting argument, isn't it?  technically speaking, if you live with a man, you are more likely to get assaulted or attacked, because men commit more crimes like that.  the logic is absolutely sound.  however, it's *also* logical, in that case, to also write 'no blacks', because black people commit more crime, proportionally speaking, than white people, so if you live with a black person, you're more likely to get assaulted or attacked.  i wonder if this woman would be happy to have the same logic applied to race, as she applies to gender.  or whether she would suddenly shout 'no way, that's racist!'.  another thought that i had is that, if we take it as correct that men are stronger and more physically dangerous than women, on average, that could work to your advantage, as well as your disadvantage, if you were a woman living with a man; this is because, if someone attacked you in your home (e.g. a burglary or something), the male you are living with would be able to defend you better than a woman could.  it's a shame we can't have discussions about this rationally without it turning into an unpleasant argument.  anyway personally speaking i think it's unfair to judge someone based on their race, gender or sexuality, it's more important to meet the person and find out what they're like, than to look at what gender they are and instantly dismiss them based on that.  but i understand women who are afraid of sharing with guys they don't know, i honestly do understand the logic.  i would be wary of sharing a place with *anyone* i didn't know well, regardless of their race, gender, or sexuality; i think people in general are fucking awful.",0

1131,"> some moderation exists on every virtual platform that i'm aware of.  moderation doesn't require that content be removed. slashdot for example, despite having moderation, never removed any comments. it just hid them from default view, but you could always browse at -1 if you really wanted to see the gnaa or goatse comments (along with a handful of well-written comments expressing unpopular views).  > that's just a quote giving context to their primary point, which is: ""people are asking how to behave on your platform, rather than solely how not to"".  i disagree that this is something that should be the responsibility of the people who run the platform. the platform administrators should concern itself with things that destabilize the platform, and provide tools so the users themselves can control the content they see.  > these are wildly different things in both a digital and legal sense. your emails are private communications. you literally have (under american law) an expectation of privacy which even the police are not allowed to violate without proper judicial and legal grounds.  usenet is perhaps a better example because it is a public forum that employs a similar model of moderation to email. the isp usenet servers oftentimes filtered spam and the binary groups, but the posts themselves weren't removed from the system; so you could usually pay for access to servers that didn't filter. and while some groups were moderated, others weren't; and the moderated groups maintained their own rules. if you preferred to read the unmoderated groups, a client-side killfile provided crude means for user-controlled filtering.  usenet's technical considerations aside, i think modern platforms would get less push-back if they adopted/improved upon that approach to moderation: the platform just serves you the messages, lets you post, and provides tools for users and groups to moderate as they see fit without global posting guidelines. if something is actually illegal (in the ""forward to the fbi upon removal"" sense), or a court orders its removal, then the admins can pull it.  > the report specifically tells them to be politically neutral as part of being more consistent with their rules because tech companies haven't been. google's failure to learn isn't a problem with the report.  perhaps not, but it may suggest that being politically neutral is one of those things that sounds easy but in practice is really hard or impossible.  > tone policing exists in a social context, whether you like it or not. it's why you can't just run up to someone and start screaming ""faggot!!!!"" in their face, and why american law would probably allow them to hit you to get away from them.  true, but i might be able to run up to a friend and do that without being hit. are tech platforms able to make that sort of distinction? so far they haven't done so, either because they don't want to, because it's a hard problem for the ai systems they're using, or because the content being flagged is being reviewed by someone who doesn't understand the context well enough to make the distinction.  > they actually say that users will have shifting desires and demands, and a one-size-all approach doesn't fit.  they say that [in context of changing their rules over time](https://imgur.com/q4vdzal). i didn't see anything in reference to suggesting allowing have control over moderation.",0

7325,">he does ban that shit in his discord. pretty sure discord also bans that shit. also, gabs argument is that loli shit is a legal grey are and already is banned in some states in the us, but i don't see many fucking people bringing that up instead of all this ""b-but muh harmless loli!"" shit.  on this i absolutely agree with you.  we wouldn't allow that shit on this sub either.  i don't criticize gab for banning loli because at the end of the day, like you said, it's a legal grey area.  nor do i criticize dankula for banning it from his discord.    the problem i'm seeing is in the hypocrisy they proudly tout while doing so.    i.e. fully supporting scat porn but having personal moral issues with drawings.  it's a retarded line to draw in the sand is all.  >are you fucking serious? i really do hope its the very fucking small minority that actually likes that shit.  one doesn't have to be a fan of loli to not have a problem with it existing.  one can even find it repulsive and still not fight to have it censored.  ""the trouble with fighting for human freedom is that one spends most of one's time defending scoundrels. for it is against scoundrels that oppressive laws are first aimed, and oppression must be stopped at the beginning if it is to be stopped at all.""  -  h. l. mencken.  >good for you?  i guess holding to my primary principles is a good thing?    all i'm saying is that if you're disgusted by loli, fine.  i would imagine almost everybody is.  just like the vast majority are disgusted by bestiality, scat, watersports, extreme bdsm, body modification, etc.  it's when we seek to impose our moral values on others that we need to step back and take a look at the bigger picture.  is lolicon simulated child pornography?  no fucking doubt.  is call of duty simulated mass murder? of course.  should not both be banned?",0

8556,"i'm going to devils advocate against crowder for a second:  i think that if you allowed for a rather generous definition of ""rape culture"", a rape culture _actually does exist_ on college campuses. hear me out.   at least, up until the recent title ix insanity, here's what's going to happen. say you have been raped, assaulted, or otherwise have a credible accusation. you go to the school administration (your first mistake!) over this. what do they do?  obviously, rape is really really bad and the school administration wants to prevent it, stop it, and bring consequences on the predator. but... there's other factors.  maybe it turns out that the accused is from a very politically well-connected family, and if you pursue action against hi, his parents make trouble for you. maybe his cousin is a major donor to the school, or he is a star student in sports or academics and has a really great reputation that the school gets to enjoy by proxy. or maybe, maybe the school just wants to keep their risk of reputation damage to a minimum.  it doesn't really matter the specifics. the fact remains that _*the university's priority is to protect the university, not the students*_. the university is working with hr bureaucracy incentives: make the problem go away as cheaply and quickly as possible so we can get back to business as usual. often times, and _especially_ in more ambiguous situations (everything from regret-sex to he-said-she-said situations), the easiest way to do that is to take the bare minimum token action so the victim feels like you did something, and then sweep it under the rug. no investigation that makes rumours spread, no spooky increase in rape stats for your campus, no potentially making powerful people mad. just make it go away.   if you're someone who is actually a victim, and you actually want justice, and you go to the administration, and this happens, you could be forgiven for believing that this is representative of a ""rape culture"". from your perspective it sure looks like _rape happened and they didn't care_. but in reality it's just a natural consequence of the fact that bureaucracies follow incentives and the university has some very strong incentives hanging over it, much stronger than one hysterical freshman.  but i would argue that it is absurd to call this a 'rape culture'. even if the situation i've laid out means that it is literally true that there is a culture that covers up rape, it is still incorrect to call that a rape culture. why?

'what do we get out of this?' 'how can this be easier?' is a misguided version of the same sentiment that spurs innovation. engineers are generally lazy, and their innovations are solutions to the question 'how can we do more with less?'. behind a senior skip day, i see an individual that questioned 'why do we go to school everyday? why are we wasting all of this effort? if we organize, how can they punish us all?' and acts on those questions by organizing the senior skip day. do i think that is a good idea? no, but that misguided endeavor was undertaken because of that individual's lack of wisdom. if that individual continues to make mistakes, learns from them and refines their actions to reflect that wisdom gained, but keeps the rebellious spirit to go against the status quo and question everything, i would put my money on that individual to go out and actually make a difference. and sure in that scenario there was a whole mess of people that mindlessly followed someone just so that they didn't have to go to school, but those are just the people that will end up working for the companies that initiating individual will eventually create.",0

10082,"i already addressed this:  you are thinking of the 6% of ~unfounded~ allegations. that means lack of evidence. the 2% of false allegations are still accurate. however, only 2/3 of sexual assaults are reported. in reality, this number is much lower-- making a false rape allegation extremely rare.   ""even strong advocates for rape victims admit that false accusations sometimes occur. the real debate is regarding the frequency of these false claims. some suggest that only 2% of rape accusations are false (a rate that is similar to that of non-sex offenses), while others state that the rate is higher (e.g., 8%).  there are several possible reasons for this wide range of estimates. for one, it appears that some analyses conflate unfounded and false. legally speaking, the term unfounded describes claims shown deemed not verifiable or prosecutable. a report may be considered unfounded if:  if there is a lack of physical evidence or there are a large number of inconsistencies between existing evidence and the victim’s claim.  thus, the terms unfounded and false are not the same. though a report might be regarded as unfounded, rape may still have taken place in actuality.""  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/finding-new-home/201810/rape-allegations%3famp",0
