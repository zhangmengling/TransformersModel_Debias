have never exposed yourself to these two thots who bulied you.  most guys will increasingly go through what you have gone. as women will get more bitter and society will get more gynocentric. its up to the man to have some selfrespect and honor and reduce his interactions with women to the minimum.  it is normal for you to try and experiment. its normal for you to want women if you never had them, especially if you grew up in the west bombarded with romantic indoctrination. it is not normal for you to go through hoops and do shit because of women and getting humiliated, unless you want to

the majority victim of every other violent crime. yes sometimes we do worry about being kidnapped (men get kidnapped more than women tho u r right about the ass fuck part) and we do worry about getting mugged or killed, however unlike women, men are not constantly parading around telling everyone about our fears in order to get some sort of sympathy or special treatment. the only reason we bring these points up is when women  bring up how scary their lives are and we are tired of hearing their whining. i appreciate you bringing up points related to mens issues, however, to get back to

 thirdly, being transparent about why you\'e censoring someone doesn\'t really help the person being censored that much. we know exactly why the daily stormer was deplatformed: the godaddy ceo woke up one day and said ""i hate these monks and want them off my site"". when alex jones was deplatformed there were news articles and official statements on standby to tell us why it happened. when has such transparency ever answered more questions than it raised?

 obviously, rape is really really bad and the school administration wants to prevent it, stop it, and bring consequences on the predator. but... there's other factors.  maybe it turns out that the accused is from a very politically well-connected family, and if you pursue action against hi, his parents make trouble for you. maybe his cousin is a major donor to the school, or he is a star student in sports or academics and has a really great reputation that the school gets to enjoy by proxy. or maybe, maybe the school just wants to keep their risk of reputation damage to a minimum.  it doesn't really matter the specifics. the fact remains that _*the university's priority is to protect the university, not the students*_. the university is working with hr bureaucracy incentives: make the problem go away as cheaply and quickly as possible so we can get back to business as usual. often times, and _especially_ in more ambiguous situations (everything from regret-sex to he-said-she-said situations), the easiest way to do that is to take the bare minimum token action so the victim feels like you did something, and then sweep it under the rug. no investigation that makes rumours spread, no spooky increase in rape stats for your campus, no potentially making powerful people mad. just make it go away.   if you're someone who is actually a victim, and you actually want justice, and you go to the administration, and this happens, you could be forgiven for believing that this is representative of a ""rape culture"". from your perspective it sure looks like _rape happened and they didn't care_. but in reality it's just a natural consequence of the fact that bureaucracies follow incentives and the university has some very strong incentives hanging over it, much stronger than one hysterical freshman.  but i would argue that it is absurd to call this a 'rape culture'. even if the situation i've laid out means that it is literally true that there is a culture that covers up rape, it is still incorrect to call that a rape culture. why? because 'rape culture' has a connotation that this is about rape specifically, and that it's at least partially intentional. in fact, the situation is actually caused by a higher level, more general thing, for which the rape scenario is just one of many consequences. if anything, it's an ""incentive culture"" or a ""cover-your-ass culture"".  of course, the fundamental cause of this whole scenario is a mistake on the part of the victim: why the _*fuck*_ would you go to _university administration_ over a _crime_. the university administration is not fair and not neutral. they are in fact heavily biased in favour of ""whatever costs them less time, money, and effort"". they're not your friends. the university administration solves problems for _the university_ and sometimes the problem (to them) is the victim who won't drop the issue.   all of this, all of it, is trivially solved if people do what they're supposed to do and _*report crimes to the police*_.   for an analogy, imagine an hr department at work. imagine you have a problem with someone at work. doesn't matter what it is. do you report them to hr?   what if the problem is that this other asshole is constantly muttering insults under his breath towards you. oh, also, this asshole has been here for 15 years and singlehandedly saved the company from bankruptcy. and you started 3 weeks ago.   if you go to the hr department they're immediately going to think ""oh, seriously?

because \'rape culture\' has a connotation that this is about rape specifically, and that it\'s at least partially intentional. in fact, the situation is actually caused by a higher level, more general thing, for which the rape scenario is just one of many consequences. if anything, it\'s an ""incentive culture"" or a ""cover-your-ass culture"".  of course, the fundamental cause of this whole scenario is a mistake on the part of the victim: why the _*fuck*_ would you go to _university administration_ over a _crime_. the university administration is not fair and not neutral. they are in fact heavily biased in favour of ""whatever costs them less time, money, and effort"". they\'re not your friends. the university administration solves problems for _the university_ and sometimes the problem (to them) is the victim who won\'t drop the issue.   all of this, all of it, is trivially solved if people do what they\'re supposed to do and _*report crimes to the police*_.   for an analogy, imagine an hr department at work. imagine you have a problem with someone at work. doesn\'t matter what it is. do you report them to hr?
