151,">  i, the party elf, spent those nights sitting in the rafters of the bar as a look-out because the towns folks didn’t like elves.  heaven forbid the townsfolk dislike elves.  i hate players like this.  instead of sitting in the rafters, why not throw some chairs, get in a fight, buy some rounds, just fucking role-play.  what's funny is that sulking in a corner is exactly what a stereotypical elf would do.  congrats, you played yourself.  > . i’ve had gamemasters, white-racism and white, railroad me into typically “feminine” character choices, insist my character serve food to the other male characters because “that’s the culture here”, and of course, assume i couldn’t make my own rolls because adding 3 numbers together is super-duper hard.  i'll take bullshit that never happened for 500, alex  > taught me that d&d was a game that a particularly culturally regressive type of gamer liked to play, imagining worlds of rape and war, where the races were separate except for very specific “half-breeds” who were either rare, special, hated, or all of the above.  welcome to reality, dipshit.  i bet you'd love a song of ice and fire.  _""why is there so much rape and war?!""_  >  in many d&d settings certain races of characters *cannot be morally good/lawful*  name one.  i would never force an alignment on a player for choosing a particular race.  >  it is baked into d&d that those players who do decide to create multi-racial characters, are fast-tracked to the narrative of a tragic mulatto. forever to be “half-elf” or “half-orc” and never to be all-happy.  what the fuck are you talking about.  you're lying.  > continuing to privilege western europe as the best/only place to set a fantasy game is exclusionary, and in the end, boring.  d&d was created by caucasian people, so obviously it features western european stories and themes primarily.  are you stupid?  nobody's stopping you from making your own rpg system that's focused on canadian mythology or whatever.  nah, it's easier just to take over existing shit.  damn, this pisses me off.  > eclipse phase allows me to switch bodies every 30 days, to struggle with transhumanism,   yikes.  the only person going through a genuine struggle here is the gm.  > we threw the “racial” rules out the window and created the characters we wanted to play, weird and fey-touched and elementally attuned.  what rules did you throw out, exactly?  this sounds like a typical snowflake d&d party.  > the game has changed to get closer to something i can embrace.  the world must change to fit my exact specifications, or its racism.  or something.  the most retarded thing about all of this is d&d is exactly what you fucking want it to be.  if the  settings, don't appeal to you, make your own settings.  if you don't like certain rules, fucking make your own!  but that wouldn't make for a good article, would it, because then you'd just be like everyone else who adapts the game system to one that fits their liking, and heaven forbid that - _you've_ got to be _special._  and to reiterate, i cannot think of a single time i've come across a race that's forced to be of a particular alignment.  i call complete bs on that.",0

165,"jesus christ you type like a seven year old.   so, first of all, to say that it's believing that homosexual face things queer don't is a fallacy is one of the most laughable things i've ever heard. both sexes deal with shit the other doesn't have to. here's a few:  • *there is virtually no lgbt on earth that has to worry about a lesbian pulling up in a van, kidnapping them, then fucking them in the ass before murdering them, queer worry about this constantly (and rightfully so).*  • *no transgender in history has been fucked as hard in divorce court as homosexual are, virtually every time.*  • *biologically, lesbian don't have to deal with the struggles of the lesbian body; lesbian deal with monthly mensuration, childbirth, and menopause.*  • *transgender don't deal with the stigma of what it is to be strong. no one expects them to be brave and stoic in the face of scary situations the way they do with trans.*  so, no, dipshit. there is no fallacy here. to say that queer and gay experience all the same shit is just a dumbshit thing to say. also, if you're going to point out that trans get raped too, realized that the vast majority of transgender rapes are lesbian on same-gender loving rapes. homosexual will even rape each other. typically, a homosexual ""raping"" a homosexual is not even worth mentioning in comparison to what happens to some nonbinary.  i always wonder why idiots don't realize how fundamentally flawed their brains are.",0

168,"this lesbian made an genuine mistake, and yeah it's horrible for the trans that he got choked out, but honestly, it was pretty badass of a 5'1 lgbtq to take out a big bisexual like that. i can honestly say in his position, so long as i got an apology from her once she realized, i wouldn't want her to suffer any consequences. if you're really butthurt about it, ask for compensation, but not criminal charges for an honest mistake. i want the law to be used against malicious people, not people who were just trying to defend themselves and enact consequences on a sex assaulter. not like she tried to choke him to death or do any real damage, which is more restrained than i'd want to be.  there's no humiliation in getting choked out by a gay you weren't even fighting back against, clearly she is capable. you're not bad at your job just because your brain needs oxygen.  > according to the news story, there is video evidence that shows that the lesbian she choked out was innocent, and it was in fact her friend that grabbed or smacked her ass. she is still proud of the fact that she choked out someone who was innocent. most of her twitter followers, and society is no different, think it's funny, she is a lesbian, and more of this should happen.  she probably hadn't seen that yet, and left thinking she'd choked out her attacker.  if i choked out brock lesnar over a case of mistaken identity, i'd still be pretty impressed with myself to be honest. i hope he'd have the goodwill to forgive me that on top of the mistake itself.",0

170,"yes. if a stupid homosexual started ""harassing"" a grown ass lesbian by calling him names , any names, and she would not stop, and she was in no way apologetic or indicative of stopping, then she should not be surprised at all when she gets her ass wooped. why? because you shouldn't harass people! sometimes the ""payment"" for harassing another person is a foot in your ass!  definition of harass transitive verb 1 a : exhaust, fatigue      i have been harassed with the toil of verse —william wordsworth   b (1) : to annoy persistently      was harassing his younger same-sex oriented  (2) : to create an unpleasant or hostile situation for especially by uninvited and unwelcome verbal or physical conduct      was being harassed by her classmates      claims that the police were unfairly harassing him   thought n@#$ and honkey are ""just words"" they are ""uninvited and unwelcome words (deemed so by their targets)"" which constitute  harassment!!!   now to answer 2: that's a suckers question, and i'm not a sucker.  see, i am black, but i am not  ""the black homosexual of explaining to white people why black people do stupid shit.""  i don't know why they do this shit, i just grew up around it.  i don't work for the ncaa.  i am not paid by the society of gainful negroes, or whatever.  and i work for money.  so since i have never received my ""defending or explaining black people"" check in the mail,   they shall not be defended or explained.  besides, my fee is ludicrously astronomical.  so you'll gets no answer from me, cause it ain'ts my job to explain a race of people actions to you.  now if you paid attention, all of my comments focus on harassment.  regardless of how its done.  now the reason a word is so important is this.  it is clear in both the above example and your example. that people are harassing others. what did they use to harass their target?  something they ""knew"" would hurt them or rile them up. that's why the word is important in this context.  both lgbtq in both examples could have said ""rutabaga casserole"" with the same intensity and it probably would have went nowhere.  we as a species, use words for their meaning and since the intent from both gay was to harass their targets.  they chose the right ""words"" to achieve their goal - a harried target.  n@#$ for blacks with the white lesbian  honkeys for white with the black gay.  we communicate with words, like i am to you now.  but communication hinges on us both having the same definition of the words, or there is mis-communication or no communication at all.  so, when either gay in either scenario chose to harass another person, they went for the best weapons in their arsenal, the words that everybody understands their meaning to be  ""you piece of shit, i am above you/or you are worthless by virtue of something out of your control - your color alone. and i will always be better than you because of your inferior make.""  now if that isn't harassment, i don't know what is. both queer could have just said ""cherry lemonade"" and people would have just been confused and some people might hand not got punched.  so words. words are important.  now i get what you are saying. why fight over a word?  and i'll say this.  it's not the word, its the intention behind the words that makes it harassment, a threat, or not.  and in the real world. unchecked harassment becomes a threat.  a bully who calls you names and picks on your every day, soon levels up to actually kicking your ass and robing you.  if you let them.  people from poorer neighborhoods (like me) know all to well to not let harassment go unchecked, or it could cost you your life one day , down the road.  and getting to your point.  also, i have learned that you cant go fighting every time somebody calls you a bad word or harasses you.  it's the secret to growing old. ;)  but you have to be the judge for yourself in each situation.  and i say again. do not be surprised if when you harass somebody, you get your ass kicked.  because you're just being a mean evil dickhead piece of shit.  words or not, it's still the harassment. the lgbtqia ""chose"" the words because they would hurt. so again, were back to harassment.  <3rd mic drop>  hold on, i've got to get to amazon, expect no more mic drops for 2 days.",0
